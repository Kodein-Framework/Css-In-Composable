= Css In Composable

This library is meant to be used with https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-html[Compose-HTML].

CiC allows you to define CSS (as opposed to Style) directly into HTML Composables.
It basically does the same thing as https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/tree/master/kotlin-styled-next:[Kotlin Wrapper Styled Components], but for Compose-HTML.

In addition to regular element style, it allows you to style children and pseudo-classes.

Have a look at that example:

[source,kotlin]
----
@Composable
fun ColoredDiv(text: String) {
    Div({
        css {
            //<1>
            backgroundColor(Color.blue)
            padding(1.em)
            textAlign("center")

            (self + hover) { //<2>
                backgroundColor(Color.red)
            }

            "a" { //<3>
                backgroundColor(Color.orange)
                textDecoration("none")
            }
        }
    }) {
        Text(text)
    }
}
----
<1> Basic style
<2> Self + pseudo-class
<3> Children

You should only use `css` for "immutable" style.
As a new CSS class is generated every time the content changes, you should use `style` for regularly changing style.
